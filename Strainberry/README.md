Strain-level assembly of viral genomes    

## To-do list  

- [ ] Add scenario where not all subtypes of FMDV recovered;
- [ ] Run de novo assemblers under the default settings and identify which assemblers don't recover all four strains;
- [ ] Identify and extract all contigs match to FMDV;  
- [ ] Run Strainberry to recover missing FMDV subtypes;


## Dataset  

Dataset for the strain separation analysis is available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uj9ZExmKr7oCrYq9YaBeVDrsj2P2QFi4?usp=sharing  

Dataset was simulated using a modified Scenario 2 abundance settings and an NBDv14-trained model.
